# Bookmark web scraping for A03

Downloads metadata for all works in your bookmarks. Works for any public
bookmarks, and has a `login()` method to access your private ones too. Data is
collected in the format below, but can be exported as JSON or CSV.

Let me know if you'd like to see any other fields or new pages that can be
downloaded. I don't actually use A03, so I'm flying a bit blind here...
